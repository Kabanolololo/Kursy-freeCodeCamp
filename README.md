# freeCodeCamp Course Progress

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through the freeCodeCamp courses. Here, I will store my completed projects, code snippets, and notes as I progress through various modules. FreeCodeCamp offers a variety of courses in web development, data visualization, and more, and this repository serves as a personal archive of my learning and achievements.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by course and module. Each main directory corresponds to a course, and subdirectories contain modules or projects within that course.
